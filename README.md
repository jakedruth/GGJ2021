## Global Game Jam - 2021

The Global Game Jam is one of the world's largets game jam event that happens every year. Participants around the world are given a theme they must loosely follow and a deadline of 48 hours to complete a game. This year's theme was "Lost and Found", a theme all about becoming lost, looking for something, or finding others. This theme is relatively open so we decided to implement a game where where you are a pirate looking for lost treasure.
