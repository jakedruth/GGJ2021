# Lost At Sea
## Global Game Jam - 2021

The Global Game Jam is one of the world's largets game jam event that happens every year. Participants around the world are given a theme they must loosely follow and a deadline of 48 hours to complete a game. This year's theme was "Lost and Found", a theme all about becoming lost, looking for something, or finding others. This theme is relatively open so we decided to implement a game where where you are a pirate looking for lost treasure.

The goal of Lost At Sea is to sail the ocean, serching for islands that seem to appear and disaper on a whim! These elusive islands contain a lot of valuable loot! You can land on any island and dig for buried treasure. After disturbing the island enough, Poseidon reclaims his land. 
Watch Out! There are pirates that want to take your gold! Keep them at bay with your cannons!

This project was created using Unity version 2020.2.2f1
