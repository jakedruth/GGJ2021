# Lost At Sea
## Global Game Jam - 2021

The Global Game Jam is one of the world's largets game jam event that happens every year. Participants around the world are given a theme they must loosely follow and a deadline of 48 hours to complete a game. This year's theme was "Lost and Found", a theme all about becoming lost, looking for something, or finding others. This theme is relatively open so we decided to implement a game where where you are a pirate looking for lost treasure.

Lost At Sea is a puzzle pirate adventure game. Your goal is to sail the ocean searching for islands that seem to appear and disappear on a whim! These elusive islands contain a lot of valuable loot! You can land on any island and dig for buried treasure. After disturbing the island enough, Poseidon reclaims his land. Watch Out! There are pirates that want to take your gold! Keep them at bay with your cannons!

This project does not fully incorporate all of our ideas and is roughly a 70% vertical slice of our full idea. Due to this, certain mechanics are not fully implemented and/ or not implemented the way we would want (just the way we needed to meet the deadline of the game jam). For example, the main island was supposed to be a central hub where you could turn in your gold and buy upgrades, more crew members, and food rations. This does not work in our prototype.

All in all, this was a super fun project that my partner and I learned a lot from. We may or may not continue working on it and any feedback would be loved. We are very much aware of most bugs/confusion but please mention it to us. Maybe you found something new.

This project was created using Unity version 2020.2.2f1
